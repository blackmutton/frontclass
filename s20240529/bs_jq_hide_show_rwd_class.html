                    Look at how they crawl around <br>
                    Upon the ground like little ants <br>
                    Yes, but how they fascinate, confusing fate <br>
                    With what is merely chance <br>
                    Isn't it a laugh? (Isn't it a shame?) <br>
                    Thinking there is someone in heaven to blame <br>
                    Yes, but even while blaming fate for the lives that they lead <br>
                    They hope for the lives that they need <br>
                    Living every day 'til the day they die <br>
                    Never getting answers (yet still asking, "Why?") <br>
                    Going through the motions as if there will be a reward <br>
                    While we stay eternally bored! <br>
                    They're only human <br>
                    They don't see, who they are is who they'll always be <br>
                    Only human, after all <br>
                    So they push and they shove <br>
                    With this thing they call love, 'til they fall! <br>
                    Isn't it a farce? (Isn't it a waste?) <br>
                    Struggling to face what can never be faced <br>
                    Yes, but maybe death can release something more than we share <br>
                    I really don't know and don't care <br>
                    They're only human <br>
                    Standing still <br>
                    Doomed to live pushing boulders uphill <br>
                    Only human, after all, so they give and they take <br>
                    Hoping someone will help break their fall <br>
                    They will pray, curse, live, die <br>
                    Never knowing their truth is another man's lie <br>
                    Eat, sleep, love, hate, like a leaf blowing in the wind <br>
                    Watch them all vacillate! <br>
                    They're only human <br>
                    They can't see <br>
                    All the years they could give you and me <br>
                    Only human, after all <br>
                    So they give and they take <br>
                    'Til their silly hearts break <br>
                    Looking down from above <br>
                    I'm intrigued by their love <br>
                    So let's call <br>

                    How has everything been turned against us? <br>
                    How did suffering become so endless? <br>
                    How am I to reunite with my estranged? <br>
                    Do I need to change? <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm surrounded by the souls of those I've lost <br>
                    I'm the only one whose line I haven't crossed <br>
                    What if the greatest threat we'll find across the sea <br>
                    Is me? <br>
                    What if I'm the monster? <br>
                    What if I'm in the wrong? <br>
                    What if I'm the problem that's been hiding all along? <br>
                    What if I'm the one who killed you <br>
                    Every time I caved to guilt? <br>
                    What if I've been far too kind to foes <br>
                    But a monster to ourselves? <br>
                    What if I'm the monster? <br>
                    <br>
                    Is the cyclops struck with guilt when he kills? <br>
                    Is he up in the middle of the night? <br>
                    Or does he end my men to avenge his friend <br>
                    And then sleep knowing he has done him right? <br>
                    <br>
                    When the witch turns men to pigs to protect her nymphs is she going insane? <br>
                    Or did she learn to be colder when she got older and now she saves them the pain? <br>
                    When a god comes down and makes a fleet drown <br>
                    Is he scared that he's doing something wrong? <br>
                    Or does he keep us in check so we must respect him <br>
                    And now no one dares to piss him off? <br>
                    Does a soldier use a wooden horse to kill sleeping Trojans 'cause he is vile? <br>
                    Or does he throw away his remorse and save more lives with guile? <br>
                    <br>
                    If I became the monster, and threw that guilt away <br>
                    Would that make us stronger? <br>
                    Would it keep our foes at bay? <br>
                    If I became the monster to everyone but us <br>
                    And made sure we got home again <br>
                    Who would care if we're unjust? <br>
                    If I became the <br>

                    And deep down I know this well <br>
                    I lost my best friend <br>
                    I lost my mentor, my mom <br>
                    Five hundred men gone, this can't go on <br>
                    I must get to see Penelope and Telemachus <br>
                    So if we must sail through dangerous oceans and beaches <br>
                    I'll go where Poseidon won't reach us <br>
                    And if I gotta drop another infant from a wall <br>
                    In an instant so we all don't die <br>

                    Then I'll become the <br>
                    Monster <br>
                    I will deal the blow <br>
                    And I'll become the <br>

                    Like none they've ever known <br>
                    So what if I'm the <br>

                    Lurking deep below? <br>
                    I must become the <br>

                    And then we'll make it home <br>

                    Penelope <br>

                    Yesterday felt like my graduation <br>
                    But now some of those kids have got their own <br>
                    Been a while since I took a vacation <br>
                    It's been a while since I really let go <br>
                    Don't wanna look back <br>
                    Thinking I could've done this <br>
                    Or I could've tried that <br>
                    Don't wanna look back <br>
                    'Cause it's going by fast <br>
                    I'ma call my mother <br>
                    It's been a while since I've been home <br>
                    Take a trip in the summer <br>
                    See all the lights in Tokyo <br>
                    Get lost in the desert <br>
                    Just to see what I can find <br>
                    So when it's my time, I <br>
                    I'm smiling when I die (when I die, when I die) <br>
                    Smiling when I die (when I die, when I die) <br>
                    Yesterday felt like my first day working <br>
                    But now I'm not the youngest on the clock <br>
                    Been a while since days were just for burning <br>
                    It's been a while since I threw back a shot <br>
                    Don't wanna look back <br>
                    Thinking I could've done this <br>

                    Smiling when I die (when I die, when I die) <br>
                    There's been a couple times that I've fell in love <br>
                    But a couple times just ain't enough <br>
                    There's been a couple joints that I could've shared <br>
                    But I guess I gotta start somewhere <br>
